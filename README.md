# Inconsistent null return from Expo Linking.getInitialURL()

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Expo's `Linking.getInitialURL()` API.  The function sporadically returns `null`, even when a deep link is successfully opened. This behavior is unpredictable and makes it challenging to build robust deep linking functionality into the app.

## How to Reproduce

While a reliable reproduction method is elusive, the issue appears more frequently on specific devices or under certain conditions (e.g., rapid app launches or background activity).

## Bug Details

The core problem is the inconsistent nature of the `null` return value. There's no clear pattern to trigger the issue.  Error handling that explicitly checks for `null` is often insufficient, requiring more sophisticated solutions.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves implementing a more robust handling mechanism. Instead of relying solely on `getInitialURL`, a combination of event listeners and a timeout is implemented.  This ensures that the app doesn't hang or crash, even if `getInitialURL` returns `null`.

This approach is more reliable and avoids relying on the erratic behavior of `getInitialURL` alone.
