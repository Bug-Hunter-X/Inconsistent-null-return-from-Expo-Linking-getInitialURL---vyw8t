This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, resulting in unexpected behavior or a crash if the app isn't prepared to handle a `null` value. This seems to happen inconsistently and is difficult to reproduce reliably. It might be related to how the OS handles the deep link, or a race condition within the Expo library itself.
